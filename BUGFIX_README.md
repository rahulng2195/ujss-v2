# UJSS Website - Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Modal Positioning Issue
**Problem:** Modal appearing below cards instead of as overlay popup
**Solution:** 
- Added `position: fixed !important` with `z-index: 99999 !important`
- Created dedicated `modal.css` file with proper layering
- Used `!important` flags to override any conflicting styles

### 2. âœ… Page Freezing on Modal Open
**Problem:** Website becoming unresponsive when modal opens
**Solution:**
- Changed from `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` to `document.body.classList.add('modal-open')`
- Added CSS class `.modal-open` that properly handles overflow
- Added `position: fixed` on body when modal is open
- Added passive event listeners for better scroll performance

### 3. âœ… Inquiry Button Not Attractive
**Problem:** Button styling was not appealing
**Solution:**
- Created gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #ff5500 0%, #ff7700 100%)`
- Added shine animation effect on hover
- Increased button size and spacing
- Added icon with proper alignment
- Added shadow effect on hover
- Created dedicated `service-card.css` file

### 4. âœ… Dark Mode Content Visibility Issue
**Problem:** White background with white text in dark mode on service detail pages
**Solution:**
- Added `!important` flags to dark mode styles in `service-details.css`
- Fixed background color: `.dark-theme .service-details-area { background-color: #0f0f0f !important; }`
- Fixed all text colors for dark mode
- Fixed card backgrounds for dark mode
- Added border to images in dark mode for better visibility

### 5. âœ… Hydration Error
**Problem:** React hydration mismatch console error
**Solution:**
- Added `mounted` state to prevent SSR/client mismatch
- Only render modal after component is mounted on client
- Added `{ passive: true }` to scroll event listener
- Conditional rendering: `{mounted && <InquiryModal ... />}`

### 6. âœ… CSS Organization
**Problem:** Inline styles causing z-index and specificity issues
**Solution:**
- Created `/public/styles/modal.css` for all modal styles
- Created `/public/styles/service-card.css` for button styles
- Moved `/styles/service-details.css` to `/public/styles/`
- Added all CSS files to `layout.tsx`
- Used `!important` where necessary to override theme styles

```
public/
â””â”€â”€ styles/
    â”œâ”€â”€ modal.css (Modal overlay and content styles)
    â”œâ”€â”€ service-card.css (Service card button styles)
    â””â”€â”€ service-details.css (Service detail page styles)
```
